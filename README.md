# Brandon Corbett

I build software systems that people can trust.

Over the years I have worked in environments that demand rigor and reliability, including roles connected to AWS, IBM, and NASA. Those experiences shaped how I think about systems design, security, and operational discipline. Infrastructure should be explicit. Authentication should be understandable. Production should behave like development. Complexity should earn its place.

Today I run Fells Code LLC and focus on building authentication and infrastructure tooling that prioritizes clarity over abstraction. My current work centers around Seamless Auth, an open source passwordless authentication system designed to be embedded directly into applications without redirect flows or hidden dependencies.

## What I Care About

Technology is only useful if it improves lives.

I care about:

- Building tools that reduce friction for developers  
- Creating systems that are secure by design  
- Making infrastructure understandable instead of magical  
- Treating users and collaborators with respect  
- Being honest about tradeoffs  

I am far more interested in long term impact than short term noise.

## Current Work

- Seamless Auth  
  Open source, passwordless authentication infrastructure

- Seamless Glance  
  Developer focused infrastructure visibility tooling  
  https://github.com/fells-code/seamless-glance-distro  

Most of my work is focused on authentication, infrastructure automation, and developer experience.

## Philosophy

I believe good software should:

- Be explicit rather than clever  
- Be secure without becoming opaque  
- Be simple without being naive  
- Improve the lives of the people who use it  

I try to build in a way that reflects those values.

## Outside of Code

I believe in being a good person first.

That means:

- Helping others without expecting leverage  
- Sharing knowledge freely  
- Taking responsibility when things go wrong  
- Choosing integrity over shortcuts  

Software is important. Character is more important.
